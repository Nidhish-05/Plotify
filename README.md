# Plotify ✨

Instantly visualize your mathematical functions. Plotify is a simple, intuitive web application that takes a mathematical equation as input and generates a clean, downloadable PNG graph. This project focuses on providing a seamless user experience, inspired by the simplicity of tools like QRify.

-   **Equation Input**: A simple text field to enter your mathematical equations (e.g., `y = x^2`).
-   **Instant Visualization**: See the graph of your equation generated in real-time.
-   **PNG Export**: Download the generated graph as a high-quality PNG file with a single click.
-   **Clean UI**: A minimalist and user-friendly interface for a distraction-free experience.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
